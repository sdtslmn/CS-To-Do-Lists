<h4>Remote Access Security Checklist</h4>

1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access to the network.
2. Use virtual private network (VPN) technology to secure remote access to the network.
3. Use a VPN concentrator or VPN gateway to centralize and secure remote access.
4. Use Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) or another centralized authentication system for remote access.
5. Use encryption to protect remote access connections.
6. Use a remote access policy to define and control who is allowed to access the network remotely.
7. Use a firewall or other security device to control and monitor remote access traffic.
8. Use network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect and block malicious traffic from remote access connections.
9. Use a remote access logging and audit system to track and monitor remote access activity.
10. Use a remote access termination system to automatically disconnect remote access sessions that have been inactive for a certain period of time.
11. Use a remote access session recording system to record remote access sessions for compliance and audit purposes.
12. Use a remote access management system to manage and monitor remote access users and devices.
13. Use a remote access self-service portal to allow users to manage their own remote access accounts.
14. Use a remote access troubleshooting and support system to assist remote users with connectivity and other issues.
15. Use a remote access security awareness training program to educate remote users on security best practices.
16. Use a remote access incident response plan to handle security incidents involving remote access.
17. Use a Remote Desktop Gateway to provide secure remote access to internal resources
18. Use Remote Desktop Services (RDS) to provide secure remote access to internal resources
19. Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to provide secure remote access to internal resources
20. Use Virtual Private Network (VPN) client software to provide secure remote access
21. Use SSL VPN to provide secure remote access
22. Use 802.1x authentication for wireless remote access
23. Use Network Access Control (NAC) to secure remote access
24. Use Remote access VPN redundancy and failover
25. Use a remote access management system to apply policies and compliance with industry standards and regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
