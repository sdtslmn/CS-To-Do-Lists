<h4> Network Segmentation To-Do List/Checklist</h4>

1. Define the different segments of your network and the specific security requirements for each.
2. Use VLANs and subnetting to physically separate different segments of your network.
3. Use access control lists (ACLs) to control traffic flow between different segments of your network.
4. Use firewalls to enforce security policies between different segments of your network.
5. Use network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect and block malicious traffic between different segments of your network.
6. Use virtual private network (VPN) technology to secure remote access to different segments of your network.
7. Use proxy servers to control and secure access to the Internet from different segments of your network.
8. Use wireless access points and wireless LAN controllers to securely segment wireless traffic.
9. Use segment-specific security devices such as intrusion detection and prevention (IDP) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
10. Use network segmentation to separate sensitive data and systems from less sensitive ones.
11. Use network segmentation to limit the potential impact of a security breach.
12. Implement network segmentation for critical infrastructure and industrial control systems.
13. Implement network segmentation for cloud environments.
14. Use network segmentation to separate test and development environments from production environments.
15. Use network segmentation to separate guest and employee networks.
16. Use network segmentation to separate IoT devices from other parts of the network.
17. Use network segmentation to separate mobile devices from other parts of the network.
18. Use network segmentation to separate virtual machines from other parts of the network.
19. Use network segmentation to separate Internet of Things (IoT) devices from other parts of the network.
20. Use Network Access Control (NAC) to restrict access to specific segments of the network based on user identity or device posture.
21. Use software-defined segmentation to create dynamic security zones based on application or user activity
22. Use zero trust network access model to provide secure access to the network.
23. Use Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to segment the network and apply security policies.
24. Use firewall and VPN gateway to segment the network and apply security policies.
25. Use network segmentation to comply with industry standards and regulations such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
